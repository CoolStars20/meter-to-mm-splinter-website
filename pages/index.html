<p class="lead">A splinter session of
  the <a href="http://coolstars20.cfa.harvard.edu/">Cool Stars 20</a>
  conference to be held July 29–August 3, 2018 in Boston, USA.</p>

<p class="lead">Radio observations of cool stellar systems provide unique
  information on their magnetic fields and high-energy processes. Buoyed by
  powerful new instruments, advances in related fields (e.g. the Gaia
  astrometric revolution), and above all a renewed interest in the relevant
  stellar astrophysics, stellar radio astronomy is experiencing a
  renaissance.</p>

<p>In this splinter session, participants will take stock of the present state
  of stellar radio astronomy and chart a course for the field’s future,
  emphasizing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Latest results: what are the cutting-edge astrophysical insights created by
    radio observations performed with powerful new facilities like the upgraded
    VLA and ALMA?

  <li>Synergies across the spectrum: what unique astrophysics can be achieved
    through the combination of observations at radio and other wavelengths?
    This question is particularly timely given the number of revolutionary
    observatories coming online (at both radio and shorter wavelengths) in the
    next few years.

  <li>Outlook for the next decade: how will studies of stellar magnetism and
    high-energy stellar processes be transformed by the next generation of
    radio facilities and complementary observatories? Special attention will
    be paid to SKA, the ngVLA, and the upcoming US Decadal Survey of astronomy
    and astrophysics.
</ul>


<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>We are committed to a conducting splinter session that upholds the Cool
  Stars 20 goal of providing an experience that is productive and enjoyable
  for all participants. In particular, we are bound by and will uphold the
  broader <a href="http://coolstars20.cfa.harvard.edu/docs/CS20_code_of_conduct.pdf">Cool
  Stars 20 Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
