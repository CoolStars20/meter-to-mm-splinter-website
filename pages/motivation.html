<h1>Motivation for the Splinter Session</h1>

<p>In this splinter session, participants will take stock of the present state
  of stellar radio astronomy and chart a course for the field’s future,
  emphasizing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Latest results: what are the cutting-edge astrophysical insights created
    by radio observations performed with powerful new facilities like the
    upgraded VLA and ALMA?

  <li>Synergies across the spectrum: what unique astrophysics can be achieved
    through the combination of observations at radio and other wavelengths?
    This question is particularly timely given the number of revolutionary
    observatories coming online (at both radio and shorter wavelengths) in the
    next few years.

  <li>Outlook for the next decade: how will studies of stellar magnetism and
    high-energy stellar processes be transformed by the next generation of
    radio facilities and complementary observatories? Special attention will
    be paid to SKA, the ngVLA, and the upcoming US Decadal Survey of astronomy
    and astrophysics.
</ul>

<p>Nonthermal radio emission, in the context of cool star radio astronomy, has
  traditionally encompassed mainly (gyro)synchrotron radiation and centimeter
  and millimeter wavelengths, i.e., emission from (mildly) relativistic
  electrons in magnetic fields. But recent years have shown a variety of other
  ways in which radio observations can deliver astrophysical insight. The
  discovery of brown dwarf radio emission has rekindled interest in electron
  cyclotron maser (ECM) emission as just one of several intriguing physical
  mechanisms in this regime, many of which are stepping stones toward studies
  of low-frequency exoplanetary radio emission. VLBI observations of stellar
  radio emission can be used to obtain precision astrometry — and hence
  precise measurements of fundamental parameters — of ultracool dwarfs or
  young stellar objects that are not accessible even to Gaia. Broadband,
  high-time-resolution studies of flares reveal the detailed plasma processes
  operating in the coronae of other stars.</p>

<p>The world’s best present-day radio observatories — chiefly the VLA and ALMA
  — launched the stellar radio astronomy renaissance. This is particularly
  true for constraints on nonthermal emission, which are particularly
  dependent on continuum sensitivity. Spectral indices, polarization, and
  variability all require high S/N detections to derive meaningful
  constraints. The upgraded VLA and VLBA as well as Arecibo now provide such
  information in the cm wavelength range, ALMA is doing so in the mm
  wavelength range, and LOFAR, MWA, LWA, HERA, and GMRT are making new forays
  into the low-frequency range. As a result of these newly feasible
  measurements, we are obtaining unique information on the role of magnetic
  fields on various scales and a new and complementary perspective on
  high-energy processes. These scales now even include outflows/jets from
  protostars and T Tauri stars, providing initial evidence for magnetic fields
  in young stellar environments.</p>

<p>The new generation of low-frequency radio observatories promises to figure
  especially prominently in the upcoming decade of stellar radio astronomy.
  These observatories can monitor the whole sky nearly continuously, surveying
  for stellar flares, coronal mass ejections, and other heliospheric
  phenomena. They are also expected to be the only facilities that will be
  able to directly probe the magnetic fields of extrasolar planets, through
  auroral radio bursts, providing unique insight into an essential facet of
  exoplanetary habitability.</p>

<p>There are important synergies of nonthermal radio emission with other
  wavelength ranges, and these will also be featured in this splinter session.
  These are mainly due to the beginning of radio time domain astronomy with
  the advent of sensitive continuum receivers, as seen for instance in the
  nearly-complete MeerKAT telescope. It is now possible to systematically
  study high-energy processes in both the X-ray and the radio time domain, and
  capabilities for doing so will increase dramatically when eROSITA commences
  operations. Understanding the correlations between optical and radio
  variability will be essential in the era of first TESS, then LSST.</p>

<p>While we expect most of the presenters to be astronomers with radio
  observing experience, our goal is to facilitate a splinter session that is
  highly relevant to a broad swathe of the Cool Stars community. For radio and
  non-radio astronomers in the audience alike, it will provide a forum to
  share the latest developments in areas such as stellar magnetism and stellar
  plasma physics. Motivated by the timeline of the US Decadal Survey and the
  suite of new instruments becoming operational in just the next few years,
  participants will pool their expertise to envision how they can leverage the
  current and upcoming generation of radio facilities to make the next round
  of discoveries.</p>
