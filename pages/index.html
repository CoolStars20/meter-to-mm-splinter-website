<p class="lead">A splinter session of
  the <a href="http://coolstars20.cfa.harvard.edu/">Cool Stars 20</a>
  conference to be held July 29–August 3, 2018 in Boston, USA.</p>

<p class="lead">Radio observations of cool stellar systems provide unique
  information on their magnetic fields, high-energy processes, and chemistry.
  Buoyed by powerful new instruments (e.g. ALMA, JVLA, LOFAR), advances in
  related fields (e.g. the <em>Gaia</em> astrometric revolution), and above
  all a renewed interest in the relevant stellar astrophysics, stellar radio
  astronomy is experiencing a renaissance. In this splinter session,
  participants will take stock of the present state of stellar radio astronomy
  and chart a course for the field’s future. <a href="motivation.html">Read
  more on the Motivation page</a>.</p>

<h2>Format of the Session</h2>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Target audience</dt>
  <dd>Astrophysicists interested in the formation, magnetism, activity,
    chemistry, and/or habitability of cool stars and their environs. While
    this splinter connects these topics through the theme of long-wavelength
    stellar emission, prior expertise in radio astronomy is
    emphatically <b>not</b> expected of attendees — <em>a major goal of the
    splinter is to enhance the dialogue between radio specialists and the
    broader community of stellar astronomers!</em></dd>

  <dt>Total duration</dt>
  <dd>Three hours.</dd>

  <dt>Introduction</dt>
  <dd>Start off with an overview of the science of long-wavelength stellar
    emission, aimed at non-specialists.</dd>

  <dt>Contributed talks</dt>
  <dd>Connecting to the themes <a href="motivation.html">motivated</a> above.
    We are particularly interested in talks that will connect long-wavelength
    stellar emission to other regions of the EM spectrum as well as a mixture
    of observational and theoretical approaches.
    See <a href="#submission">above</a> for the form to submit a contributed
    talk.</dd>

  <dt>“Unconference” style</dt>
  <dd>Ample time will be reserved for discussion, letting the topics of
    interest emerge organically from the structured portions of the session.</dd>

  <dt>Forward-looking</dt>
  <dd>Although the discussion topics will (hopefully!) range widely, we expect
    to conclude with an outlook on upcoming observatories and their role in
    the upcoming US Decadal Survey. After having heard the latest results from
    observational capabilities that are still new, the session thus will end
    on a forward-looking note to identify the most exciting science questions
    and to strategize the advocacy that will ensure that these questions get
    answered in a resource-constrained environment.</dd>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>We are committed to a conducting splinter session that upholds the Cool
  Stars 20 goal of providing an experience that is productive and enjoyable
  for all participants. In particular, we are bound by and will uphold the
  broader <a href="http://coolstars20.cfa.harvard.edu/docs/CS20_code_of_conduct.pdf">Cool
  Stars 20 Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
